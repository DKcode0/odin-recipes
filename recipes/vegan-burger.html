    <h2>Best Vegan Burger</h2>
        <p>Say hello to the BEST veggie burger recipe! Of course, that’s just my opinion, but once you try it, I think you’ll agree. For one, these patties are grill-able! And if you’d rather be spending time in the sun than in the kitchen, you can even make them a day or two in advance.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tamari, balsamic vinegar, and mirin</strong> bring out the savory flavor of the mushrooms.</li>
            <li><strong>Smoked paprika and sriracha </strong> make these burgers smoky and spicy. </li>
            <li><strong>Finely chopped garlic and shallots</strong>add depth of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Crushed walnuts</strong>give them a meaty bite.</li>
            <li><strong>Short grain brown rice, panko bread crumbs, and ground flaxseed</strong>help these burgers hold together. DON’T use long-grain brown rice here. It’s not as sticky as short grain rice, so it doesn’t yield cohesive patties.</li>

        </ul>
